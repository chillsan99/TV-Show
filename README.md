# Getting Started with Create React App
TV-Show-App
This is a multiple page web application for Anime Television Shows. I built this as a way for me and my friends to look up various shows without having to use an extensive wbesite such as MyAnimeList, or AniList and to be able to see  popular shows along with ratings of the shows before even having to get into the show information to see what people have rated a show. 

This is built primarily with React (and as a result is my first React project) as well as elements of CSS. 
Since I was advised so many times to build a bigger project with React, and I didn't want to do anything boring for my first project, I decided that messing around with API's and building something more extensive for my friends would be the best adventure into building a project. 

The tutorial that I followed was [React Crash Course- Build A Full Recipe App Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc4uOzlndAk&t=4820s&ab_channel=DevEd) by DevEd! 

Once uploaded, I plan to build off of this project, and add more features, such as popular and highly rated mangas as well, and a more extensive Genre category. 

This also uses Jikan's RESTful version of the API. 


## Usage

Currently this project is using Jikan's version 3 API. The problem with this version is that most of the titles of the anime shows are in romaji (Romanized Japanese). Once version 4 is updated and has a lot of the kinks worked out, I will move it to that version where it will be easier to search by english titles. I apologize for this issue beforehand. 

To find a show, or genre, click the buttons at the top, or use the search bar to search for a specific show. 

## Contributing
If you have any ideas how I can expand this website and turn it into a cooler website, please do not hesitate to let me know. I'd love to grow this website into a bigger more usable project for everyone.
